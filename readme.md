## *Lab-1 Summary*

This lab introduces some of the tools used in this course, including a modern code editor, Visual Studio Code, version control with Git, and remote repository hosting with GitHub. It will also discuss how to make your projects on GitHub stand out, with good documentation, code presentation and pages; and how to use your GitHub account as a development portfolio.

## *Lab-2 Summary*

The purpose of this lab is to briefly introduce the View component of the MVC, and particularly to introduce the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML). In this tutorial we will explore the building blocks of the front end of the web by discussing the different elements that make up the View, what they do and how they interact. We will then focus especially on HTML, the core building block of all websites.
